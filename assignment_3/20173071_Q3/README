Assignment-3 Q3: (External Sorting)
================

- External Sorting is a class of algorithms used to deal with massive amounts of data that do not
  fit in memory.
- The question aims at implementing one such type: "K-Way merge sort" algorithm to sort a very large
  array.
- This algorithm is a perfect example of the use of divide and conquer where with limited resources
  large problems are tackled by breaking the problem space into small computable subspaces and then
  operations are done on them.


INPUT CONSTRAINTS:
1. A file containing a large unsorted list of integers (Will not fit in your usual Laptop RAM).
2. Do not use any in-built data structures.


OUTPUT:
A file containing non-Descending sorted list of the given integers


EVALUATION PARAMETERS:
1. Time and Space Complexity of the algorithm
2. Efficient use of Data-Structures


INPUT FORMAT:
Your code should take two arguments.
• First is the name of input file.
• Second is name of output file.


EXAMPLE:
- If your input file is at ./data/input.txt And if you need your output file at ./data/ named output.txt
- For c++, code should be of format rollnumber_Q3.cpp compiled file should accept two arguments
  ./a.out “./data/input.txt” “./data/output.txt”


GENERATION of UN-SORTED FILE:
- To generate the unsorted file, python script is uploaded along with this pdf. It contains all the
instructions required to run it.


SUBMISSION FORMAT:
Submit it as rollnumber_Q3.cpp
