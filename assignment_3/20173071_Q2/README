Assignment-3 Q2: (TRIE Implementation)
================
- You will be given an array A of N numbers and Q queries.
- Each query will contain a single integer 'x'.
- You have to find then maximum xor of x from any number in A.


CONSTRAINTS:
• 1 <= N, q <= 10 ^ 5
• 1 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 12


INPUT:
First Line contains N and q
Second line contains N space separated intergers.
Next q lines contain q queries of single integer


EXAMPLE:
3 2
1 2 3
4
5

EXPLANATION:
A = {1, 2, 3}
Case 1: x = 4 Maximum xor of x is with 3, therefore answer is 4 xor 3 = 7
Case 2: x = 5 Maximum xor of x is with 2, therefore answer is 5 xor 2 = 7
